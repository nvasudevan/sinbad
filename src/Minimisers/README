 Brief description of Minimisers
================================================================================

Min1
  Minimise a given grammar iteratively.
    - Check for ambiguity, and using the ambiguous output,
      build a minimised grammar. Apply this routine iteratively.

Min2
  Minimise a given grammar iteratively by remove one alternative at a time.
    - Check for ambiguity, and from the ambiguous output,
      build a minimised grammar. 
    - Iteratively, remove an alternative from the minimised grammar,
      and keep checking for ambiguity. 
      
Min3
  Minimise a given grammar in two phases:
    - Check for ambiguity, and from the ambiguous output,
      build a minimised grammar. 
    - Run AmbiDexter on the minimised grammar; if ambiguity found,
      the pass the ambiguous string to ACCENT, to create the final
      minimised grammar
